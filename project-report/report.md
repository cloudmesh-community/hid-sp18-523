## Abstract

In current world, data is getting generated and stored with different 
storage systems. We need to use this data for a better understanding, 
analyze and can estimate the future scenarios with certain probability. 
There are many algorithms, which have developed and implemented for 
providing better accuracy on the future scenarios.

## Introduction

Scikit learn is a library created for machine learning algorithms,
which uses different datasets gathered over years to learn and predicts
future scenarios. This library have methods for implementing supervized
and unsupervized machine learning algorithm.
Supervised algorithms are on the dataset, which has the target variable,
which need to be predicted or estimated. This datasets can be acted with
below different approaches
Classification is based on the classes and the labeled data, we need to
predict the unlabeled data.
Regression is based on the continuous variable or data, we need to
predict the future state of data is known as regression
Unsupervised algorithms are on the dataset, where we do not see the
target variable for prediction, we learn its behavior set of vector
input variable to identify the clustering group of similar behavior data 
or sample [@sckitml]. Kaggle is a known location for different kind of 
datasets gathered by various institutes across globe.

## Scope of work

Below are the 3 algorithm from Scikit learn

* Implement Linear Regression
* Implement Boosted Decision
* Implement Hyper-tuned Boosted Decision

## Reason

We are planning to use Regression learning algorithm because the target
variable is numerical and continuous in nature. We will be creating ML
pipeline using linear, regularized linear, tree and forest learning
algorithm. We will compare and evaluate different models based on RMSE
of learning algorithm [@sckitml].

## Technology Stack

Python will be used for Data loading, preprocessing and cleaning. Using
Scikit learn library, we will implement variety of algorithms to conduct
above process and finally will predict the sale price of its products.

REST services has been implemented to provide a prediction of price of
the products:

* REST data preprocessing: It will be the service, which does the data
  processing with removal or imputing the data with mean or median.
  Removal of the columns which doesn’t any correlation with target
  variable
* REST data prediction: it will be the service, which will do multiple
    predictions using multiple algorithms as below
* Rest API with Linear Regression – Display the outcome of product and
  predicted price
* Rest API with Boosted Decision – Display the outcome of product and
  predicted price
* Rest API with Hyper-tuned Boosted Decision – Display the outcome of
  product and predicted price

Cloud technology utilized will be Microsoft Azure, AWS, it has been
implemented at Local machine and Docker.
We have acquired the dataset from Kaggle and read the data dictionary
details on different websites which includes below describes attributes.
We have 14204 instances and 13 attributes in the dataset, which will be
spitted into Training and Test Data set. This dataset is available on
public websites
BigMart Dataset, With this dataset, we will predict the sale price of
various products based on the learning of historical data in the
datasets using different algorithm. The dataset has various data with
respect to

* Item Fat Content
* Item Identifier
* Item MRP
* Item Outlet Sales
* Item Type
* Item Visibility
* Item Weight
* Outlet Establishment Year
* Outlet Identifier
* Outlet Location Type
* Outlet Size
* Outlet Type
* source

[@kaggleds].

## Dataset Details

* test dataset  - https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/hid-sp18-523/blob/master/project-code/test.csv
* train dataset - https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/hid-sp18-523/blob/master/project-code/train.csv

It has following 12 attributes with continuous and categorical values
with Unique Values

* Item Fat Content has 5 unique values
* Item Identifier has 1559 unique values
* Item MRP has 8052 unique values
* Item Outlet Sales has 3494 unique values
* Item Type has 16 unique values
* Item Visibility has 13006 unique values
* Item Weight has 416 unique values
* Outlet Establishment Year has 9unique values
* Outlet Identifier has 10 unique values
* Outlet Location Type has 3 unique values
* Outlet Size has 4 unique values
* Outlet Type has 4 unique values

## Data Visualization

distribution of data of different variables from the dataset.
These are the important feature influencing the predicted 
output

![Histogram of Important Attributes](images/HistrogramofImpAttributes.png){#fig:HistogramofImportantAttributes}

In +@fig:CorrelationMatrixbetweenVariables shows the 
plot about the corelation between variables in the dataset.
This will display the features which are higly correlated in 
darker color.

![Correlation Matrix between Variables](images/Correlation.png){#fig:CorrelationMatrixbetweenVariables}

## Data Exploration

Analyzed and plotted the categorical and continuous feature summaries to 
see which feature is closely related with target variable. This helped
us with deciding which feature are influencing the prediction.

## Data Preprocessing

* Missing values (2439) of item weight is replaced with mean.
* Missing values (4016) of outlet size observations, which been
  replaced with mode.

## Azure ML Studio

Azure ML studio provides the GUI interface for creating the Machine
Learning Train models and Predictions. It provides a provision to
integrate with Azure Cloud and expose the Web Services

## Train Model with Azure

Created on Azure ML Studio, 3 Learning Algorithms used

* Boosted Decision Tree
* Linear Regression
* HyperTuned Boosted Decision Tree

As seen in the results below in +@fig:RMSEComparisionResults and +@fig:HypertunedAlgorithmRMSEComparision 
regarding the RMSE result scores, Hyper-tuned Boosted Decision 
Tree has provided better results.

![RMSE Comparision Results](images/RMSEComparison.png){#fig:RMSEComparisionResults}

![Hypertuned Algorithm RMSE Comparision](images/RMSEComparisionBetweenHypertune.png){#fig:HypertunedAlgorithmRMSEComparision}

## Predictive Model

Update the Trained model with Test dataset for predicting the Item
Outlet Sales data. Verified and updated the data cleaning process which
we have implemented for Train dataset. After converting the categorical
data with indicators, we can apply the trained model.

Created predictive model using the above Hyper-tuned Boosted Decision
Tree.

From the score function, have extracted only 2 columns

* Item Identifer
* Item Outlet Sales

In below +@fig:OutputofPredictionfromModels shows WebService
input and WebService Output using the selected model on
the dataset with predicted value.

![Output of Prediction from Models](images/PredictionOutputfromModel.png){#fig:OutputofPredictionfromModels}

## Web Service Deployment

Once the Prediction model has been executed successfully, it can be
deployed as web service from Azure ML Studio.

+@fig:AzureMLStudioWebserviceDeploy shows the generated
API key, which will be used for Azure Cloud deployment.

![Azure MLStudio Webservice Deploy](images/Webservicedeploy.png){#fig:AzureMLStudioWebserviceDeploy}

It will provide an option to Test web service locally with below options

* Click on Test button enabled at the bottom of the screen
* Download the CSV file from the tool to test the Web API with
    prediction model.

## Azure Cloud deployment

Once Web Service is created locally, It creates a hyper link
with name of the web service. On clicking this hyperlink 
service dashboard opens up that let the develop set up and 
configure web service on Azure cloud for consumption as 
shown in the below +@fig:WebServiceConfigrationDetails. 

It provides test tab on the dashboard where we can provide
inputs and get the prediction values given by model after 
clicking on Test Request response button.

This step will assure that, the web services are working as expected.

![WebService Configration Details](images/Webserviceconf.png){#fig:WebServiceConfigrationDetails}

After clicking consume tab from Dashboard, It will display option for
Response Request Web Template link.

Copy the request response link generated on the page.

Once clicked on the link, it will redirect to Azure cloud configuration
using Response Request Web application.

Azure ML Request, Response Service Web App In Azure cloud, it need to
created as

* Create the request response service web app
* Create Resource Group
* Add Model Management services
* Click on the URL link generated under resource group
* Update the Settings with API POST URL
* Update the API key generated from Web service from Azure ML studio.

Expose the Web Service from Azure cloud

Click on the below link to access the prediction web service
* <https://predictbigmart.azurewebsites.net/>

Entered the values used to for testing locally, from the 
+@fig:WebServiceResult, we see that amount should matched
which confirms service is functioning as expected for
predicting values.

![WebService Result](images/WebService.png){#fig:WebServiceResult}

Batch Mode for Web Service Execution Download the CSV generated from
Azure ML Studio

* Open the CSV, it will be open with Web API built in
* Use Sample data link on the API
* Select the range of columns and provide as input to API
* Select the cell from where the prediction values needs to be
  displayed.
* Click on Prediction button. It will generate the prediction values
  for all the selected Input entries with Item Identifiers.

+@fig:BuiltAPIonCSVFile shows the API got created on the CSV format
file, for generating the predicted values using the features from
the dataset. These predicted values matches with the values 
generated from the local or webservice created.

## Drawback of using Azure ML Studio

Azure ML studio provides easy to use drag and drop objects for
all steps (from model intialization to deployment) such as 
data preprocessing, training model, fitting model, evaluating 
model, tuning model and prediction. It is every easy to use and
handy tool for data scientists and data engineer. However, it has 
a drawback; developers are not able to generate the code that is 
generated at the backend for further experimentation and testing.

## Azure with Notebook Instance

Notebook instance of Azure ML Studio was used to execute python
code file for benchmarking. Code containing data preprocessing, 
training model, fitting model, evaluating model, tuning model and 
prediction steps was executed on Azure notebook instance. 
It took 15.2 ms for overall batch prediction using notebook. 
Computation time using model saved on disk was recorded  as 
1.95 mili seconds as shown in below code.

### Code

```python

import pickle
filename = 'finalized_model.pkl'
pickle.dump(clfgrdmof, open(filename, 'wb'))

 
# load the model from disk
loaded_model = pickle.load(open(filename, 'rb'))
Test1 = loaded_model.predict(testr[predictors])
